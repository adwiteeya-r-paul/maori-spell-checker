# Maōri-Spell-Checker

This program implements a probabilistic spell-checker for Cook Islands Maōri, a low-resource Polynesian language. This program is part of the broader effort of developing Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for low-resource languages.

## Tools used

The spell-checker is inspired by [Peter Norvig's basic probabilistic spell-checker model](https://https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html). The code has been adapted to Cook Islands Maōri, and has been extended to include the following features:

1. Accepting and correcting real-time user input 
2. Normalizing input string to be comparable to dataset
3. Handling punctuation (,.!)
